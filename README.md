## üåå Overview
AlphaFusion fuses statistical, classical ML, and deep-learning models into a modular engine for **robust, explainable stock forecasts and actionable trading signals**. Designed for clarity, extensibility, and production readiness.

Designed for **traders, analysts, and financial institutions**, it delivers **robust, transparent, and auditable predictions** for decision-making.


**Highlights:**
- Multi-model ensemble predictions: **SARIMAX, Prophet, XGBoost, LightGBM, RandomForest, LSTM, CNN-LSTM, Attention-LSTM**  
- Error-weighted ensemble & meta-learning for robust forecasts  
- Backtesting with **Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, fees & slippage modeling**  
- Advanced technical indicators & trading signals (EMA, MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, ATR, OBV, Breakout, Fibonacci, Swing/Scalping strategies)  
- Outputs: **JSON files** for structured predictions & **plot images** visualizing forecast trends
