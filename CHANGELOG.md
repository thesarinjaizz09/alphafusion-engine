## [v1.2.0-beta] - YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** Beta (Under Development)

**Features (Current / Active):**
- Computes **80+ technical indicators** from OHLCV data.
- Computes **30+ trading strategies** (breakout, mean reversion, swing, scalping, volume, price action, regime detection, etc.).
- Supports **stocks, ETFs, and cryptocurrencies** across multiple timeframes.
- Prints weighted strategy signals with bullish/bearish confidence scores and reasons.
- Outputs JSON per candle with all indicators, strategies, and signal summaries.
- Console output enhanced with Rich tables and panels for easy reading.
- Designed for **live analysis**, ML model integration (SCSO-LSTM, HMM, XGBoost, RandomForest, etc.) will be added in future updates.
- Multi-threading / parallel processing for strategy calculation and future model training.

**Notes:**
- Still under active development.
- ML/forecasting models from previous versions are not yet integrated.
- Focused on indicator and strategy engine for robust signal calculation.

  - Trend indicators (ADX, Ichimoku, SuperTrend, PSAR, HMA slope, KAMA slope).
- Neural signal fusion (ensemble of strategies with weighted scoring).
- Confidence scoring: bullish/bearish, confidence %, and reason logging.
- Multi-model forecasting pipeline with **parallel execution via ThreadPoolExecutor**.
- Automatic feature engineering (OHLCV + technical indicators).
- PSO/SCSO hyperparameter optimization hooks.
- Logging:
  - Structured console + file logging.
  - Rich-powered live epoch logging for LSTM/BiLSTM.
  - JSON exports of per-candle analysis.
- CLI usage for predictions, strategies, and ensemble forecasts.
- Lazy imports for heavy dependencies (TensorFlow, Prophet, XGBoost).
